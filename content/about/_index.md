Hey there 👋🏽,

I am Abigail Afi Gbadago.
This is my personal blog where I will note my learnings, ideas, updates and things to look forward to.

In recent years, life has pulled me across a few different paths — from backend engineering to strategic tech partnerships, tech leadership, dev advocacy, and so much more.

A couple of years ago, I wanted to understand software systems better, grow my technical and soft skills, and show up more — through open source, public speaking, and community work — and I’ve done that successfully.

These days, I solve problems with code through education rather than code happily solving me as a problem in production deployments. Less wrangling microservices, containers, but more of creating tutorials, writing about concepts, and helping others make sense of this beautiful chaos called tech.

And when I’m not doing that, on the weekend, I’m busy with grad school work — figuring out topics like decision-making, Bayes’ Theorem, conditional probability, inductive reasoning, leadership, business case studies, and so much more 😅
